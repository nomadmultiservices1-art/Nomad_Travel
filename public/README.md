# Public Assets - Performance Optimization

## Airport Data Optimization

This directory contains optimized assets for slow connection scenarios:

### Files:
- `airport-codes.csv` (8.5MB) - Complete airport database
- `.htaccess` - Server configuration for compression and caching

### Optimization Strategies Implemented:

1. **Progressive Loading**: Essential airports load instantly, full database loads in background
2. **Caching**: Browser localStorage caching with 24-hour expiration
3. **Compression**: Server-side gzip compression (via .htaccess)
4. **Fallback Strategy**: 10-second timeout with essential airports fallback
5. **Background Loading**: Full dataset loads asynchronously after initial render

### Performance Benefits:
- **Instant UI**: Airport search available immediately with essential airports
- **Reduced Bandwidth**: Cached data prevents repeated downloads
- **Slow Connection Friendly**: 10-second timeout prevents hanging
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Better experience as full data loads

### Cache Management:
- Cache key: `nomad_airports_v1`
- Cache duration: 24 hours
- Automatic cache invalidation on version updates
